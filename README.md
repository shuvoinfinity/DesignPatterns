Design Patterns in C# (.NET 9)

This repository contains practical, well-structured implementations of all Gang of Four (GoF) Design Patterns using C# and .NET 9.
It is intended as a reference and learning resource for developers who want to understand and apply design patterns effectively in real-world .NET applications.

🎯 Purpose
Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems.
This repository demonstrates:
Clean, idiomatic C# implementations of all 23 GoF patterns.
Practical examples with clear separation between concept and usage.
Modern C# features (records, pattern matching, dependency injection, async/await, etc.) where applicable.
Guidance on when and why to use each pattern, not just how.
